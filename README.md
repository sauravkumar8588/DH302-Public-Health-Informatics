  - Group project report (PDF), references
- **README.md**: Overview and usage instructions

## Topics Covered

- Hypothesis testing and p-value analysis
- Parametric/non-parametric tests (t-test, chi-square, Wilcoxon)
- Data visualization: boxplot, violin/ridgeline, density, Q-Q, PCA
- Distribution fitting (Normal, Poisson, Gamma) in R
- Sample size calculation
- Real-world case studies (NEET-UG scores, quality of life, nutrition, medical datasets)
- Group Project: Machine learning pipeline for antibiotic resistance prediction (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM), clinical relevance assessment

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/dh302-analysis.git
    cd dh302-analysis
    ```
2. Open R code in `/code/` or run in RStudio.
3. For the group's ML project, run Jupyter notebooks in `/group_project_PredictR-x-AI/`.
4. View assignment PDFs in `/assignments/`; explore `/data/` for datasets.
